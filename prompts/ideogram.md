A pixel art style ebook cover featuring a glowing
command line terminal as the central focus, displaying green text commands "git init", "git add", and "git commit" against a dark screen. The terminal is surrounded by stylized pixelated data nodes and branching pathways in electric blue and cyan, creating a network-like pattern that represents Git's workflow structure. A small pixel art developer boy and girl characters sit beside the terminal, with geometric shapes and glowing particles scattered throughout the composition. The background uses deep purples and midnight blues with subtle gradients, while the title "Git Descomplicado: Do 'init' ao 'commit' sem dor de cabeça" appears in clean, modern typography at the top and bottom of the cover in a 3:4 aspect ratio.
